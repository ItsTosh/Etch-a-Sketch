# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project for the Odin Project

Skills I used for this project are:
- Basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills
- DOM manipulation
- Event manipulation

Skills I learnt for this project are:
- New HTML attributes such as `<name>`, `<color>`
- Further application of `toString`
- Enhanced my knowledge with code cleanliness, and improved my JavaScript, HTML, and a bit of CSS skills 

Design was heavily inspired by Michalosman's version of Etch-a-Sketch
